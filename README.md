Welcome to all.

Iâ€™m a mechatronics engineer, and graduated from the Federal University of Uberlandia.
Since 2016 I have worked in software development and systems management and support.
I have a very support focused profile. I learn a vast amount of programming languages, finding and fixing a large amount of bugs and errors, looking for the best customer experience.
I have a fast pace of learning, with a good adaptability, which makes me more agile to fix errors and problems in currently deployed applications, without worrying much about the software primary language. But I don't have much experience in complete development.
Iâ€™m experienced a vast amount of computer languages, which varies from low level ones, like Assembly or C, to Back-end high level, such as C#, JAVA, VB, Front-end HTML, CSS, and even relational and non-relational databases, such as MSSQL, MySQL and MongoDB

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on these side projects:
    	A colaborative checklist aplication (to better do my groceries)
    	A colaborative budget control App (to get stats on my monthly purchases)
  	An application thats develops fast thinking
  	
  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning
    JAVA (primary V17 on personal base and V11 on a professional enviroment)
    SpringBoot (V3.1.2)
    Maven deploys
    C# .NET 4.7.2 (windows application)
    Tomcat (local and webservice hosting)
    AWS RDB - SQL
    AWS EC2

  All of my codes is open to public, only with the AuthAPI as an exception)
